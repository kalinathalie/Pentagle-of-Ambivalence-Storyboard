1
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:36,758
You didn't seem to mind spending your time

2
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,522
With this crazy guy whose eyes were wide

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,934
open for you

4
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,405
For a time, we had it good

5
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:43,816
I did the best I could

6
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,581
Til I lost you on the way

7
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:48,052
You stood up for yourself

8
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:49,464
Had to put us on the shelf

9
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:51,228
For another day
