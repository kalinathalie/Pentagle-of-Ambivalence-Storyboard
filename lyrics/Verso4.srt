00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,280
I'm feeling small when I make the call full of alcohol

2
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,840
And then there's dead air on the phone with you

3
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,460
With my disguise, I didn't realize when I was hurting

4
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,490
That I was hurting you too

5
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,870
So when I lost my way

6
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,280
Couldn't think of what to say

7
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,050
I watched us fall apart

8
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,340
There's an opportunity

9
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,710
It's here for you and me
